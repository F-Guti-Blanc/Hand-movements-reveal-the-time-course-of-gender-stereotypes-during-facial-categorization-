1.1 MAD Curvature Index. Mixed-Effect Model.

To find the optimal model to fit the MAD variation in our data, we performed two procedures. 
The first to identify the optimal structure for fixed effects and the second for random effects.

First, to find the optimal structure of the fixed effects, all possible mixed models were designed by 
varying this structure and leaving the random effects of participants and stimuli untouched. Then, only 
the models that had no problems of fit or convergence were selected(using as exclusion criterion the 
outputs that indicated error in the R program after running each of the models), resulting in a total 
of 3 models. Model 1 (lmer1_FE) considered Congruence, Task and their interaction as fixed effects.
Model 2 (lmer2_FE), Congruence and Task without interaction effect, while model 3 (lmer3_FE), only the
fixed effect of Congruence. To select the best fitting model, the 3 models were gradually compared one
by one, based on their complexity, using likelihood ratio tests and Akaike's information criterion, AIC 
(a lower value indicates a better fit). The results of the likelihood ratio test showed a significant
difference between models 1 and 2 (X2 (1) = 11.034, p < 0.001), with the first model (lmer1_FE, AIC = 76586)
providing a better fit than the second (lmer2_FE, AIC = 76595). We then compared model 1 with model 3, again 
finding significant differences between the two (X2 (2) = 53.163, p < 0.001), with a better fit of the first 
(lmer1_FE, AIC = 76586) compared to the third (lmer3_FE, AIC = 76635).

Once the optimal structure of the fixed effects, was found, we performed the same procedure, this time varying
the structure of the random effects. Of all the possible models, only 4 gave no fit problems. Model 13 (lmer13_RE)
considered the interaction between the random effects (participants and stimuli) with the variable Task. Model 3 
(lmer3_RE), only the interaction between the random effect participants and task. Model 15 (lmer15_RE), the interaction
between the random effect stimuli and Task. Finally, Model 5 (lmer5_RE) did not include the interaction of the random
effects with any fixed effects. Likelihood ratio tests revealed significant differences between models 13 and 
3 (X2 (2) = 17.4, p < 0.001), with a better fit of the first (lmer13_RE: AIC = 76573; lmer3_RE: AIC = 76586), and significant
differences between models 13 and 15 (X2 (4) = 21.694, p < 0.001), again with a better fit of model 13 (lmer13_RE: AIC = 76573;
lmer15_RE: AIC = 76586). However, no difference (X2 (2) = 4.3238, p = 0.1151) was found between model 13 and model 5. 

Taken together, these results suggest that the model that best explains the variability of the MAD indices in our data considers 
as fixed effects the Congruence, the Task and its interaction, and as random effects the participants, the stimuli and their 
interaction with the Task.
